### Hi there, I'm Shengyan Lee

A `Kubernetes` senior back-end services developer and consultant.

### Glad to see you here!

I'm an engineer focused with `Kubernetes` and `Golang`. most of my work is design and implement `Kubernetes` back-end services and architecture optimization. So developing use `Golang` is fond of me.

-   As a `developer`, I am interested in the implementation of some details, my unequivocal love for making things that change the world. That's why I like to make things that make a difference.

-   As a `consultant`, I believe that the best way to learn is to teach. I like to share my knowledge with others and grow with them. I am also a `blogger`, I like to write some articles to share my experience and thoughts.
